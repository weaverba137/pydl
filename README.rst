Description
-----------

Python replacements for functions that are part of the IDL_ built-in library, or
part of astronomical IDL libraries.  The emphasis is on reproducing results of
the astronomical library functions.  Only the bare minimum of IDL_ built-in
functions are implemented to support this.

There are four astronomical IDL libraries targeted:

* idlutils_
* `Goddard utilities`_ (which are distributed with idlutils)
* idlspec2d_ : tools for working with SDSS/BOSS spectroscopic data
* photoop_ : tools for working with SDSS imaging data

This package affiliated with the astropy_ project and is registered with PyPI_.

History
-------

This code was initially developed on the SDSS-III_ `svn repository`_.  It was
moved to the new GitHub_ repository on 2013-03-06.  The present location of
the repository is http://github.com/weaverba137/pydl .
