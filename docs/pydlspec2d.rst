SDSS Spectroscopic Data  (`pydl.pydlspec2d`)
============================================

Introduction
++++++++++++

This package provides functionality in the SDSS idlspec2d_ package.  This
package is used for processing and analyzing data from the SDSS optical
spectrographs.  The code is thus relevant to the `SDSS Legacy`_,
BOSS_ and eBOSS_ surveys.  This package does *not* work with any infrared
spectrograph data associated with the APOGEE-2_ survey.

The primary *technical* focus of this particular implementation is the function
:func:`~pydl.pydlspec2d.spec2d.combine1fiber`.  This function is responsible
for resampling 1D spectra onto a new wavelength solution.  This allows for:

1. Shifting a spectrum from observed redshift to rest frame.
2. Coaddition of spectra of the same object, after resampling all spectra onto
   the same wavelength solution.

The primary *scientific* motivation of implementing
:func:`~pydl.pydlspec2d.spec2d.combine1fiber` is to create template spectra
based on curated spectra of, *e.g.*, luminous red galaxies (LRGs).
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or other techniques may be used to
construct template spectra, but putting all spectra on the same
rest-frame wavelength solution is the first step.

The idlspec2d package is itself divided into a number of subpackages.  Below we list
the subpackages and the usability of the PyDL equivalent.
The readiness levels are defined as:

Obsolete
    No point in implementing because the purpose of the code lapsed many years ago.
Not Applicable (NA)
    No point in implementing because another built-in or numpy/scipy/astropy package completely replaces this.
None
    Not (yet) implemented at all.
Rudimentary
    Only a few functions are implemented.
Fair
    Enough functions are implemented to be useful, but some are missing.
Good
    Pretty much anything you could do with the idlspec2d code you can do with the equivalent here.
